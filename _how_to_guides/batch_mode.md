# Running tests unattended in CI

Sometimes you want to run the tests on the command-line, and simply receive a report of what passed and failed. Typically this is when you are on some kind of Continuous Integration server. TextTest supports 'Batch Mode' for precisely this usecase.

## Report in JUnit format
Configure your CI server to collect test results in the same format as JUnit.
