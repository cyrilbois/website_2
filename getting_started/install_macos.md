# Install TextTest on MacOS

The TextTest development tools use the GUI toolkit [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is not always straightforward to install on MacOS. Follow these instructions: [Getting Started with PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

If this installation process fails, my best advice is to instead try out TextTest on a temporary machine on EC2. Follow these instructions to [Install TextTest on Amazon Linux](/reference/install_amazon_linux.html) and connect to it using VNC from your mac.
